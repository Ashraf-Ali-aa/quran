# The Open Quran Project

**!!!** *This is a largely incomplete work in progress.*

OQ is an English translation of the Quran. The source code for the translation,
and the tools used to convert the source to HTML (and eventually other formats)
is all effectively open source. An official license will be added soon.

This repo currently includes:

- A Quran translation, formatted using a simple, domain specific markup language.
- A Python 2.7 parser that produces JSON ASTs from the translation source.
- A complete collection of JSON AST files, updated with each edit.
- A prettified copy of the translation, as a single HTML file.

Only roughly twenty verses are ready to read, and are at the very end (bottom)
of the HTML file.

This translation is based on previous work by the [Free Minds Community][1],
and we are especially indebted to their lead translator Layth, who has led
translation efforts in our community for many years.
