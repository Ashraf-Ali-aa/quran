# The Open Quran Project

OQ is an English translation of the Quran. The source code for the translation
and the tools used to convert the source to HTML is all open source.

This repo currently includes:

- A Quran translation, formatted using a simple, domain specific markup language.
- A Python 2.7 parser that produces JSON ASTs from the translation source.
- A complete collection of JSON AST files, updated with each edit.
